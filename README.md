# Railway Templates

Railway Templates are an easy way to deploy your favorite apps to Railway. You can deploy templates from our [templates page](https://railway.app/templates).

This repository handles GitHub focused discussions about Railway templates. We handle Template bounties, feature requests, and bug reports here.

To submit a Template, [use the publishing flow within the Templates page tied to your account.](https://docs.railway.app/reference/templates#publishing-a-template)

This repository's former purpose was created to been created to allow users to submit their templates to the list of templates displayed on our [templates page](https://railway.app/templates). We have since moved to a new system that allows users to submit templates directly from the Railway UI.

## Creating a template

You can create a template by visiting our [button page](https://railway.app/button) or by converting an existing project into a template via the project settings page. Please note that templates can only be created if the services are linked to a public repository. If you link to a private repository, the template will not work.

Using the button, you can create a template that can deploy multiple services and databases. You can configure the environment variables, start command, health-check path and root directory for each service while also specifying whether or not we should attach a domain to the service.

## Submitting a template

To submit a template for viewing, you can use the publish flow within the product like so. 

Once approved, your template will show up on our [templates page](<(https://railway.app/templates)>) with the `Community` tag.

## Template Bounties

We have a bounty program for templates. If you create a template that we think is awesome, we'll pay you a set amount. You can find more information about the bounty program on our Bounty project [linked in this repo.](https://github.com/orgs/railwayapp/projects/2)
